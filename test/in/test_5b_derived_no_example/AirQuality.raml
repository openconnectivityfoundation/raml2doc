/CurrentAirQualityResURI:
  description: |
    This API defines the mapping between the ASA AirQuality interface and the OCF AirQuality Resource.
    The OCF Resource is an array of objects, each instance in the array equates to an instance of the ASA AirQuality Interface if more than one instance is exposed.
    The mapping defined in the schema describes the population of the OCF array object.
    There shall only be single instance of an OCF AirQuality Resource. The array size therein equates to the number of instances of the ASA CurrentAirQuality interface that are exposed.
    When mapping from OCF the valueType of the Resource shall be introspected, this API is invoked only if this is set to 'Measured'
